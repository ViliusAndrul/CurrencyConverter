# CurrencyConverter
A simple currency converter that scrapes a website for currency data.
This application was not necessarily made for efficiency purposes, hence the use of webite scrapping instead of an API. This is a practice project.
If you still want to try it out, you will need:
  1. JDK 22.0.2 or above;
  2. If you have older JDK versions installed, you'll need to remove them from your system environment variables so only the 22.0.2 version remains.
